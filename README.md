Implement an ARP Spoofer in Python
In this chapter, we discussed how to execute an ARP spoofing attack. For
this exercise, you’ll write a Python program that allows you to perform an
ARP spoofing attack with a single command, shown here:

kali@kali:~$ sudo python3 arpSpoof.py <VICTIM_IP> <ROUTER_IP>

To do this, you’ll need to write a program that performs the steps dis
cussed in this chapter. Your program should generate spoofed ARP packets
and send them to both the victim and router. Once the attack is complete,
your program should restore the ARP tables to their original state. Write
your program (arpSpoof.py) in Python, and use the Scapy library to construct
and send the packets. We’ve included skeleton code here:
